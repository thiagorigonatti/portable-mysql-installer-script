## This script will install MySQL8.0.29 in Windows operating system for you easy

Make sure to download https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.0/mysql-8.0.29-winx64.zip from the oficial website
and make sure to have downloaded `my.ini` file also

1. Check for administrator permissions
2. Extract mysql-8.0.29-winx64.zip to C:\MySQL\
3. Copy my.ini file to C:\MySQL\MySQL-8.0.29\
4. Create uploads folder according to my.ini option
5. Try to create a service named `MySQL80` if it already exists the script will prompt you to enter a name to a new service

Then you can change your root password by typing this on MySQL server

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewPassword';
flush privileges;
exit;
```

Note: If you put a password for root you need to change start MySQL80.bat file as the following:

`C:\MySQL\MySQL-8.0.29\bin\mysql.exe -u root`
to
`C:\MySQL\MySQL-8.0.29\bin\mysql.exe -u root -p YourNewPassword`
